### BAM files

In St. Jude Cloud, we store aligned sequence reads in BAM file format for whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, and RNA-seq. For more information on SAM/BAM files, please refer to the [SAM/BAM specification][bam-spec]. For research samples, we require the standard 30X coverage for whole genome and 100X for whole exome sequencing. For clinical samples, we require higher coverage, 45X, for whole genome sequencing due to tumor purity issues found in clinical tumor specimens. For RNA-Seq, since only a subset of genes are expressed in a specific tissue, we require 30% of the exons to have 20X coverage in order to ensure that at least 30% of the expressed genes have sufficient coverage.

### gVCF files

We provide gVCF files produced by the [Microsoft Genomics Service][msgen]. gVCF files are derived from the BAM files produced above as called by [GATK's haplotype caller][gatk-haplotype-caller]. Today, we defer to [the official specification document][gvcf-spec] from the Broad Institute, as well as [this discussion][gvcf-diff-from-vcf] on the difference between VCF and gVCF files. For more information about how Microsoft Genomics produces gVCF files or any other questions regarding data generation, please refer to [the official Microsoft Genomics whitepaper][msgen-whitepaper].

### Somatic VCF files

Somatic VCF files contain HG38 based SNV/Indel variant calls from the St. Jude somatic variant analysis pipeline as follows. Broadly speaking:

1. Reads were aligned to HG19 using [bwa backtrack][bwa] (`bwa aln` + `bwa sampe`) using default parameters.
2. Post processing of aligned reads was performed using [Picard][picard] `CleanSam` and `MarkDuplicates`.
3. Variants were called using the [Bambino][bambino-paper] variant caller (you can download Bambino [here][bambino-download] or by navigating to the [Zhang Lab page][bambino-program] where the  "Bambino package" is listed as a dependency under the CONSERTING section).
4. Variants were post-processed using an in-house post-processing pipeline that cleans and annotates variants. This pipeline is not currently publicly available.
5. Variants were manually reviewed by analysts and published with [the relevant Pediatric Cancer Genome Project (PCGP) paper][pcgp-landing-page].
6. Post-publication, variants were lifted over to HG38 (the original HG19 coordinates are stored in the `HG19` INFO field.).

!!! note
    **Our Somatic VCF files were designed specifically for St. Jude Cloud visualization purposes. Variants in these files were manually curated from analyses across multiple sequencing types including WGS and WES.**  
    For more information on variants for each of the individuals, please refer to the relevant PCGP paper. For more information on the variant calling format (VCF), please see the latest specification for VCF document listed [here][hts-specs].


### CNV files

CNV files contain copy number alteration (CNA) analysis results for paired tumor-normal WGS samples. Files are produced by running paired tumor-normal BAM files through the [CONSERTING][conserting] pipeline which identifies CNA through iterative analysis of (i) local segmentation by read depth within boundaries identified by structural variation (SV) breakpoints followed by (ii) segment merging and local SV analysis. [CREST][crest] was used to identify local SV breakpoints. CNV files contain the following information:

### Feature Counts files

Feature counts are text files that contain counts of reads aligned to genomic features. St. Jude Cloud feature files are generated using HTSeq. The detailed command is documented in our [RNA-Seq V2 RFC][rnaseq-rfc]. The files contain a count of the number of reads overlapping each genomic feature, in this case, genes as specified in [GENCODE V31][gencode]. St. Jude Cloud uses the gene name as feature key. The files are tab-delimited text and contain the feature key and read count for that feature.

## Sequencing Information 

### Whole Genome and Whole Exome
Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) and Whole Exome Sequence (WES) BAM files were produced by the [Microsoft Genomics Service][msgen] aligned to HG38 (GRCh38 no alt analysis set). For more information about how Microsoft Genomics produces BAM files or any other questions regarding data generation, please refer to [the official Microsoft Genomics whitepaper][msgen-whitepaper].

### RNA-Seq

RNA-Seq BAM files are mapped to HG38. For alignment, `STAR` v2.7.1a 2-pass mapping is used. Below is the `STAR` command used during alignment. For more information about any of the parameters used, please refer to the [STAR manual][star-manual] for v2.7.1a. The complete RNA-Seq WDL pipeline is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/stjudecloud/workflows/blob/master/workflows/rnaseq/rnaseq-standard.wdl). The STAR alignment parameters are also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/stjudecloud/workflows/blob/master/tools/star.wdl).

## Data Access Units
We currently have the five [Data Access Units (DAU)](../requesting-data/glossary.md#data-access-unit) listed below. [Basic clinical data](#clinical-and-phenotypic-information) is available for relevant subjects in each DAU. Click on the DAU's abbreviation below to navigate directly to that DAU's [Study page](../../../guides/studies/index.md) for more detailed information.

### Pediatric Cancer Genome Project (PCGP)
**[PCGP](https://stjude.cloud/studies/pediatric-cancer-genome-project) is a paired-tumor normal dataset focused on discovering the genetic origins of pediatric cancer.**
The Pediatric Cancer Genome Project is a collaboration between St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine that sequenced the genomes of over 600 pediatric cancer patients. 

### St. Jude Lifetime (SJLIFE)
**[SJLIFE](https://sjlife.stjude.org/) is a germline-only dataset focused on studying the long-term adverse outcomes associated with cancer and cancer-related therapy.**
St. Jude Lifetime (SJLIFE) is a longevity study from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital that aims to identify all inherited genome sequence and structural variants influencing the development of childhood cancer and occurrence of long-term adverse outcomes associated with cancer and cancer-related therapy. This cohort contains unpaired germline samples and does not contain tumor samples. 

### Clinical Genomics (Clinical Pilot, G4K, and RTCG)
**[Clinical Genomics](https://stjude.cloud/studies/clinical-genomics) is a paired tumor-normal dataset focused on identifying variants that influence the development and behavior of childhood tumors.**
Clinical Genomics is a cohort from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, comprised of three studies: Clinical Pilot, Genomes4Kids, and Real-time Clinical Genomics. Clinical Pilot is a smaller, pilot study generated to asses the validity and accuracy of moving forward with the G4K study. The RTCG study aims to release Clinical Genomics data in real time to the research community. The goal of these studies is to identify all inherited and tumor-acquired (somatic) genome sequence and structural variants influencing the development and behavior of childhood tumors. 

### Sickle Cell Genome Project (SGP)
**[SGP](https://sickle-cell.stjude.cloud/) is a germline-only dataset of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) patients from birth to young adulthood.**
The Sickle Cell Genome Project (SGP) is a collaboration between St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine focused on identifying genetic modifiers that contribute to various health complications in SCD patients. Additional objectives include, but are not limited to, developing accurate methods to characterize germline structural variants in highly homologous globin locus and blood typing.

### Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS)
**[CCSS](https://stjude.cloud/studies/clinical-genomics) is a germline-only dataset consisting of whole genome sequencing of childhood cancer survivors.**
CCSS is a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary, NCI-funded collaborative resource established to evaluate long-term outcomes among survivors of childhood cancer. It is a retrospective cohort consisting of >24,000 five-year survivors of childhood cancer who were diagnosed between 1970-1999 at one of 31 participating centers in the U.S. and Canada. The primary purpose of this sequencing of CCSS participants is to identify all inherited genome sequence and structural variants influencing the development of childhood cancer and occurrence of long-term adverse outcomes associated with cancer and cancer-related therapy. 

!!! warning "CCSS: Potential Bacterial Contamination"

    Samples for the Childhood Cancer Survivorship Study were collected by sending out Buccal swab kits to enrolled participants and having them complete the kits at home. This mechanism of collecting saliva and buccal cells for sequencing is highly desirable because of its non-invasive nature and ease of execution. However, collection of samples in this manner also has higher probability of contamination from external sources (as compared to, say, samples collected using blood). We have observed some samples in this cohort which suffer from bacterial contamination. To address this issue, we have taken the following steps:

    1. We have estimated the bacterial contamination rate and annotated each of the samples in the CCSS cohort. For each sample, you will find the estimated contamination rate in the `Description` field of the `SAMPLE_INFO.txt` file that is vended with your data (and as a property on the DNAnexus file). For information on this field, see the [Metadata specification](#metadata).
    2. Using this estimated contamination rate, we have removed 82 samples which exhibited large rates of bacterial contamination.
    3. For the remaining samples, we have provided the `BAM` file as aligned with `bwa mem` with default parameters. We have observed that there are instances of reads originating from bacterial contamination that are erroneously mapped to the human genome and display a *very* low mapping quality. Please be advised that we have kept these reads as they were aligned and have not yet made any attempt to unmap these reads. Any analysis you perform on these samples will need to take this into account!
    4. Last, we will be working over the coming months to unmap the reads originating from bacterial contamination and release updated `BAM` files along with the associated `gVCF` files from Microsoft Genomics Service.

    With any questions on the nature or implications of this warning, please contact us at [support@stjude.cloud](mailto:support@stjude.cloud).

### Pan-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (PanALL)
PanALL comprises cases of B-progenitor and T-lineage ALL encompassing the spectrum of ALL subtypes across the age continuum. Samples sequenced were obtained from multiple sites, centers and cooperative groups including St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, The Children’s Oncology Group, The Alliance – Cancer and Leukemia Group B, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, The Southwestern Oncology group, MD Anderson Cancer Center, City of Hope National Medical Center, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Northern Italy Leukemia Group, and UKALL.

## Metadata 

Each data request includes a text file called `SAMPLE_INFO.txt` that provides a number of file level properties (sample identifiers, clinical attributes, etc).

### Standard Metadata

 Below are the set of tags which *may* exist for any given file in St. Jude Cloud. All optional metadata will have `sj_` prepended to their tag name.

### Clinical and Phenotypic Information

Also included is a set of phenotypic information queried from the physician or research team's records at the time of sample submission to St. Jude Cloud. These are all considered to be *optional*, as the level of information gathered for each sample varies. If empty, the physician or research team did not indicate a value for the field. All basic clinical or phenotypic information will have `attr_` prepended to their tag name.

### Diagnosis Codes

!!! note
    During the release of the St. Jude Cloud paper, we undertook a massive effort to curate and harmonize diagnosis values within St. Jude Cloud. We provide two values for diagnosis, and you should select carefully which value you use based on your use case:
    
    1. `sj_diseases`, which, since August 18, 2020, represents the harmonized diagnosis value curated by scientists on the St. Jude Cloud team (before that time it represented the diagnosis known at time of sequencing).
    2. `attr_diagnosis`, which contains the unharmonized diagnosis value directly as it was submitted to us from the lab or PI.

    **If your data request was processed after August 18, 2020 and you'd like to use the most up to date, harmonized diagnosis**, we recommend using `sj_diseases` field. If your data request was made before this time *or* if you wish to use the values exactly as provided by the lab or PI, we recommend using the value in `attr_diagnosis`.

The `SAMPLE_INFO.txt` file that comes with your data request will contain the list of associated harmonized diagnosis codes (`sj_diseases`) for each sample. These codes represent the harmonized diagnosis values curated by the St. Jude Cloud team and reflect the most up to date information about the sample. Below, we include the full set of diagnosis values in St. Jude Cloud Genomics Platform, the category of the tumor, and the closest available OncoTree term. We regularly work with the OncoTree committee to update new subtypes, so any discrepancies between our diagnosis code and the OncoTree term can be interpreted as more granular classifications that OncoTree does not yet account for.

| Tumor Category         | Diagnosis                                                      | Diagnosis Code | Corresponding Oncotree Code |
